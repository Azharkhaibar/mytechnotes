**DNS (Domain Name System)** is a decentralized naming system for Internet addresses. It enables the creation of human-readable names (domain names) that correspond to the numeric IP addresses used by computers, making the web more accessible to users.

## Structure of DNS

DNS is composed of numerous independent nodes, each responsible for storing only the data relevant to its specific area. This decentralized structure enhances the reliability and efficiency of the system.

## Key Components

### DNS Resolver
A **DNS Resolver** is a server typically located close to your Internet Service Provider (ISP). It performs the following functions:
- Searches for addresses based on domain names.
- Caches responses (temporarily stores them) for quick retrieval in future requests.

## DNS Record Types

There are several types of DNS records, each serving a unique purpose:

- **A Record**: Associates a domain name with an IPv4 address.
- **AAAA Record**: Links a domain name with an IPv6 address.
- **CNAME Record**: Redirects one domain name to another.
- **MX Record**: Specifies mail exchange servers for the domain.
- **NS Record**: Indicates the authoritative name servers for the domain.
- **PTR Record**: Provides the domain name associated with an IP address.
- **SOA Record**: Contains administrative information about the domain.

Understanding DNS is crucial for navigating the Internet, as it plays a vital role in translating user-friendly domain names into machine-readable IP addresses.
